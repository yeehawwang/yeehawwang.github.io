I am a passionate undergraduate student at [Emerging Parallel Computing Center (EPCC)](http://epcc.sjtu.edu.cn), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, directed by [Prof. Quan Chen](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~chen-quan/index_EN.html). My academic journey is driven by a deep interest in understanding the fundamental principles of computing systems and artificial intelligence. I am currently immersing myself in the study of Operating Systems and Machine Learning Systems, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical implementations. My academic focus lies at the intersection of system engineering and machine learning, where I strive to understand how complex systems can be optimized and made more efficient. I believe in the importance of building strong foundational knowledge in both traditional computer science disciplines and cutting-edge technologies. This dual focus allows me to approach problems with both systematic thinking and innovative solutions. My research interests primarily revolve around: Operating Systems Architecture and Machine Learning System Design. I am particularly fascinated by how system-level optimizations can enhance the performance of machine learning applications, and I'm committed to exploring the synergies between these two domains.
